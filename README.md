# Dice Game

This is a simple Python script implementing a dice game where the user competes against the computer. In this game, both the user and the computer roll a specified number of dice, and based on certain strategies, they decide whether to roll again or hold. The winner is determined by comparing the total sum of dice rolls between the user and the computer.

## How to Play

1. Run the `dice_game.py` script.
2. Enter the number of dice you want to roll when prompted.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to roll the dice, make choices (whether to roll again or hold), and see the computer's moves.
4. The game will announce the winner at the end based on the total sum of dice rolls.
